## 🚀 About Me
I’ve been coding for many years, moving from sales management into software development.  
Today, I focus on building **scalable, modern solutions** and sharing projects that other devs can use, learn from, or contribute to.  

I’m not here looking for jobs — I’m here to **create, collaborate and have fun building stuff together**.

---    

## 🔧 How I Build
I care more about principles than tools:  
- Code should be **clear and resilient**  
- Architectures should be **modular and adaptable**  
- Software should **solve real problems**, not just look fancy  
- Learning never stops — I’ll pick up whatever stack is needed

---   

## 🎯 What to Expect Here
This space is just getting started.  
I’ll be sharing projects I’m passionate about, documenting the process, and learning in public.  
If you’re curious, feel free to follow along or jump in — collaboration is always welcome.

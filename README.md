## 🚀 About Me
I’ve been coding for many years, moving from sales management into software development.  
Today, I focus on building **scalable, modern solutions** and sharing projects that other devs can use, learn from, or contribute to.  

I’m not here looking for jobs — I’m here to **create, collaborate and have fun building stuff together**.

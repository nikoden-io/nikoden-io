#### Hello,  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> 

⏳ Over 7 years of experience as a Sales Director? Been there, done that.

🚀 Made a leap into the tech world in 2020? Check.

💼 Currently thriving at Domintell, where I found my sweet spot by merging my love for coding with my penchant for people skills.

🛠️ My tools of choice? TypeScript, JavaScript, React Native, ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, and more recently, Dart & Flutter.

🎯 Together, we've turned ideas into reality - architecting robust software and mobile applications 📱, integrating advanced features, and exploring the exciting realm of home automation and embedded technologies.

📈 As for team management, I guide us through a customized Agile-like workflow. But I believe management goes beyond issuing directives. It's about understanding and supporting each unique member of our team 🌈. Recognizing everyone's strengths has been the key to our shared success 🏆.

💡 Today, I'm more than just a tech lead with a knack for React/React Native and TypeScript. I strive to be the person who champions his team, ensuring that everyone feels valued.

🤝 If you're intrigued by my journey or see the potential for us to create something amazing together, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect!

I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge, and I am excited to see what the future holds in this dynamic and ever-changing field.
